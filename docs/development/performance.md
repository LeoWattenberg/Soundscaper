# Editor performance

Loading, timeline rendering, audio processing, and project publication have
separate scaling constraints. Profile the affected workflow with representative
project sizes, channel counts, and storage backends before extending an
optimization. The [quality diagnostics](quality-diagnostics.md) guide owns
performance observations and correctness thresholds; build and coverage
budgets remain in their machine-readable registers.

## Scaling contracts

| Area | Contract | Focused regressions |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Timeline queries | Reuse indexes for immutable documents and keep repeated viewport queries proportional to visible content. Include index construction in measurements. | [Clip windows](../../tests/audio-editor-timeline-viewport-index.test.ts), [duration](../../tests/audio-editor-timeline-viewport-duration.test.tsx), [snapping](../../tests/audio-editor-boundary-snap.test.ts) |
| Video overlap presentation | Bound retained pair geometry and use viewport-only generation for dense overlaps. Preserve visible pairs and invalid clip IDs. | [Overlap presentation](../../tests/audio-editor-video-overlap-presentation.test.ts) |
| DSP | Share channel-independent work while preserving PCM, rounding, telemetry, and state across chunks. Retained history owns its buffers; transferred packets must not expose borrowed storage. | [Sinc kernels](../../tests/audio-editor-streaming-resample-kernel.test.ts), [frequency peaks](../../tests/audio-editor-frequency-waveform-band-peaks.test.ts), [live dynamics](../../tests/audio-editor-live-dynamics-gain-work.test.ts), [borrowed input](../../tests/audio-editor-resample-borrowed-input.test.ts) |
| Retention and autosave | Update retention roots incrementally. Coalesce superseded queued saves while preserving explicit flushes, project switches, dirty state, rollback, and retry after failure. | [Retention](../../tests/audio-editor-session-retention-index.test.ts), [autosave queue](../../tests/audio-editor-autosave-queue-performance.test.ts), [memory publication](../../tests/audio-editor-project-memory-publication-performance.test.ts) |
| Revision pruning | Use scalar keys for canonical revisions, accept historical key formats, retain the current document, and keep requests inside their IndexedDB transaction. | [Pruning](../../tests/audio-editor-project-revision-pruning-performance.test.ts), [browser publication](../../tests/browser/audio-editor-storage-publication.spec.js) |
| Command preparation | Reuse privately owned immutable projections and invocation-local indexes. Preserve authored order, duplicate-reference authority, validation, and missing-reference errors. Arbitrary mutable inputs retain uncached admission. | [Project Bin](../../tests/audio-editor-command-project-bin-performance.test.ts), [paste collisions](../../tests/audio-editor-paste-existing-clip-index.test.ts), [snapshot equality](../../tests/audio-editor-project-snapshot-equality.test.ts) |
| Startup | Keep optional UI and processing engines in their deferred feature owners. Batch independent settings reads while preserving fallback and disposal behavior. | [Deferred ownership](../../tests/audio-editor-deferred-startup-ownership.test.ts), [bootstrap](../../tests/audio-editor-project-bootstrap-concurrency.test.ts), [browser loading](../../tests/browser/editor-startup-progress.spec.js) |

Further optimizations must preserve the [editing performance boundaries](editing-performance-opportunities.md).
[Smaller candidates](performance-candidates.md) need current profiles before
implementation.

## Measurement and reproduction

Use Node.js 26.5.0 and npm 12.0.1. Begin with a failing behavior or operation-count
regression for the suspected cost, establish audio/pixel/ownership parity, then
compare timings with the same host, fixture, preference, warm-up, and repetition
count. Keep setup outside timed intervals and report preparation separately
from repeated queries.

Run the relevant committed regressions from the repository root, for example:

```sh
node --import tsx --import ./scripts/node-style-asset-loader.mjs --test tests/audio-editor-timeline-viewport-index.test.ts tests/audio-editor-video-overlap-presentation.test.ts
node --import tsx --import ./scripts/node-style-asset-loader.mjs --test tests/audio-editor-streaming-resample-kernel.test.ts tests/audio-editor-frequency-waveform-band-peaks.test.ts tests/audio-editor-live-dynamics-gain-work.test.ts
```

For paired kernel measurements, prepare isolated baseline and current checkouts.
Record the exact revisions, source hashes, fixture geometry, and any source or
build overlays. A recorded HEAD alone cannot reproduce uncommitted source
variants. Each bundle must resolve production modules and ownership brands
inside its own checkout; both roots need the shared fixture factory required
by the harness. Restore historical variants from Git deliberately when needed.

```sh
node --import tsx scripts/performance/measure-editing-responsiveness-round4.ts /path/to/baseline /path/to/current test-results/performance/editing.json
node --import tsx scripts/performance/measure-responsiveness-round4.ts /path/to/baseline /path/to/current test-results/performance/runtime.json
node --import tsx scripts/performance/measure-dsp-responsiveness-round4.ts /path/to/baseline /path/to/current test-results/performance/dsp.json
```

These tools check parity outside timers and record alternating raw trials.
Kernel and operation-count probes measure their named work; measure storage,
worker startup, React publication, and first useful feedback separately when
assessing a complete editor operation. Some older prototype probes assert a
historical source pattern; update their fixtures deliberately when that
mechanism changes. Use explicit garbage collection for retained-heap comparisons.

For Electron interaction measurements, stage a fresh app under
`.desktop-build/app` using the [desktop build workflow](../operations/release.md).
The harness creates an isolated profile, checks the default Speed preference
through the existing menu, and observes real canvas painting and playback.

```sh
xvfb-run -a node --import tsx scripts/performance/measure-electron-editing.mjs test-results/performance/electron.json --round4
```

Record runtime versions, viewport/DPR, storage backend, host load, rendering
backend, and whether a run includes first-use engine preparation. Compare total
completion with renderer long tasks and frame gaps. Xvfb animation-frame
intervals describe renderer scheduling; GPU presentation and real-model
inference need representative hardware and models. Local production previews
also cannot establish field network latency or production cache behavior.
Keep each original failed run and its separate retry distinguishable in the
change's review evidence. Store generated output under `test-results/`.

## Correctness and guardrails

Keep semantic chunk groups, the 500,000-byte production JavaScript chunk ceiling,
startup graph budgets, coverage floors, and source-file size ratchets. Read
current graph costs from each build's `.startup-graph-report.json`; earlier
measurements do not describe the current bundle. Optional features enter through
menus and load with their owning feature.

Run checks appropriate to the affected owners: changed lint, focused numerical
or ownership regressions, the canonical non-browser gate, and browser workflows
for interactive changes. Evaluate coverage floors over the required union of
Node and Chromium evidence. Reassess the manual **Update AI assets** requirement
when a proposed optimization changes the generated assistance runtime closure
or target file inventory.
