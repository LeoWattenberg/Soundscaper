# Round seven ordinary user-path bug audit

Target: 200 additional distinct bugs reached through existing user paths.
The worktree is `/home/splowatt/git/Soundscaper-user-path-bugs-200`, branch
`fix/user-path-bugs-200-oct9`, based on `47b61f6e7`.

## First checkpoint: 50 fixes

| Area | Qualified IDs | Count | Causal and focused evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Editing and navigation | R7-EDIT-001–013 | 13 | [Editing register](bugfix-round7-editing.md) |
| Dialogs and controls | R7-DIALOG-001–006, 008–016 | 15 | [Dialogs register](bugfix-round7-dialogs.md) |
| Effects and analysis | R7-EFFECT-001–009 | 9 | [Effects register](bugfix-round7-effects-analysis.md) |
| Import, export and media | R7-IO-001–003, 005–014 | 13 | [IO register](bugfix-round7-io.md) |
| Total | | 50 | All focused tests and complete qualified public paths pass. |

The unchanged complete last-wave workflows pass 9/9 in Chromium against
prepared capture `58264ec46`. Earlier focused public batches and their exact
receipts are recorded in the area registers. The first complete repository and
browser-suite gates are pending; no further bug implementation starts until
this checkpoint has run.

Setup failures, unsupported int32 delivery, unpublished image-boundary commands,
and the surround-Reverb hypothesis do not count. Repeated manifestations and
follow-through corrections share their original root count. The build's module
ownership guards caught missing owners before the checkpoint; corrections
preserve their semantic groups and all existing size/graph ceilings.

Verification diagnostics are removed after their result is recorded. Permanent
regression tests remain. Desktop assistance engine sources, recipes and runtime
closures are unchanged; no manual **Update AI assets** run is required.
